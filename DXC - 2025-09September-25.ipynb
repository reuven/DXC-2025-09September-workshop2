    "# The story so far\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, we saw how we can write command-line programs that take arguments. We saw:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Arguments are parsed largely by the shell\n",
    "- We get the results of that parsing in a list of strings (`sys.argv`)\n",
    "- We can use `argparse` to interpret `sys.argv` on our behalf\n",
    "    - Types\n",
    "    - (including files)\n",
    "    - Required\n",
    "    - Keyword arguments\n",
    "    - Defaults\n",
    "    - Even accept a number of values for the same argument!\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this contributes to a healthy command-line program. Typically, that kind of program (like many command-line utilities) runs with the inputs from the arguments and then does it computation and then prints some results."

    "2. The `__name__` variable is always defined. It contains a string value, which will be one of two things:\n",
    "    - The string `'__main__'`, which means that it was the first program/module to run, not imported by someone else\n",
    "    - The string corresponding to the module's name, e.g., `mycmd`, which indicates that the file was imported by someone else\n",
    "3. Because the entire file is executed, and because `__name__` has this two-value potential, we can use `if` to determine whether it's running as the main program and then run something appropriate.\n",

    "This allows us to have modules that are both modules (importable) and programs (runnable). This line distinguishes between what happepns when we import (above the line) and what happens when we run (the entire file)."

If you define `do_xyz`, then the command `xyz` will exist. And if you type `xyz abc` on the command line in the program, then `do_xyz` will be invoked, and `abc` will be passed as its argument."
