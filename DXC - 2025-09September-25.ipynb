    "\n",
    "- Arguments are parsed largely by the shell\n",
    "- We get the results of that parsing in a list of strings (`sys.argv`)\n",
    "- We can use `argparse` to interpret `sys.argv` on our behalf\n",

    "    - Even accept a number of values for the same argument!\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this contributes to a healthy command-line program. Typically, that kind of program (like many command-line utilities) runs with the inputs from the arguments and then does it computation and then prints some results."
